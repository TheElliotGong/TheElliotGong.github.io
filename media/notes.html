<h1>Elliot Gong: Portfolio Design Process</h1>
<p>
Right now, my main goal in creating my portfolio page is have <br>
somewhere to displaymy work while also applying my HTML and CSS skills. <br>
My web development experience is still a work in progress, so my desired <br>
audience is the average web user as they won't be expecting too much from <br>
a page like this. Using new techniques and tools for this assignment is also <br>
useful as I can get more exposure to the more advancedaspects of web design. <br>
Even though this is just a prototype, I want to make this as close to the final <br>
version as possible. 
<br>
Now, I've made some edits and added my custom content to the page, so it's more polished.
I'll move it out of the 235 folder later, and perhaps into an external service.

</figure>

As you can see, my design sketches for my web page is fairly basic, but that's <br>
the intention. I want to keep things simple, and just get the point across as this<br>
is my own personal page. Of course, I want to make my website as accessible and <br>
responsive as it can be, and be easy to figure out and navigate.

<h1>Final Notes</h1>
<p>
    If I can, I'll add a contact form as well. In addition, I'll see if <br>
    I can edit my gallery to be a slideshow. Tweaking the navigation for <br>
    different devices is also one of my stretch goals. And maybe adding <br>
    some additional style elements and interactivity to my page would be nice.
    <br>
    I'll probably keep editing this even after the 'final submission'. <br>
    I know it could be better, especially when dealing with automatic <br>
    alignment of the content. and I have yet to implement some special <br>
    features and elements.
    <br>
    I've made some edits and tweaks to the css and index file. I've also <br>
    included some of my later projects like Project 2 and 3. For the presentation <br>
    itself, I've fixed a few visual problems and just optimized some functions.
