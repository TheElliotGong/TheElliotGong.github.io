# Quick Start Guide - React Portfolio

## Get Started in 3 Steps

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
cd TheElliotGong.github.io
npm install
```

### 2. Start Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```
- Opens at a local URL (typically `http://localhost:5173`)
- Hot reloading enabled - changes appear instantly

### 3. View Your Portfolio
Navigate to the URL and you should see:
- ✅ Navigation with burger menu (test at mobile sizes)
- ✅ Hero section with headshot and social links
- ✅ Project gallery with 27 projects across 4 categories
- ✅ Collapsible project categories (collapse on mobile, expand on desktop)
- ✅ Experience/employment section
- ✅ Contact form
- ✅ Footer with dynamic year

## Testing Checklist

### Mobile Responsiveness
- [ ] Resize browser to <= 1023px
- [ ] Verify project categories are collapsed
- [ ] Click burger menu icon (3 lines) - should toggle navigation
- [ ] Verify text is readable and properly spaced

### Desktop View
- [ ] Resize browser to > 1023px
- [ ] Verify project categories are automatically expanded
- [ ] Verify burger menu is hidden
- [ ] Check that navigation links are visible

### Functionality
- [ ] Click on project cards - should open links/images
- [ ] Hover over social media icons - should show cursor
- [ ] Try clicking email icon - should open mail client
- [ ] Try submitting contact form

### Images & Assets
- [ ] All project images should load
- [ ] Headshot should display with rounded corners
- [ ] Social media icons should appear
- [ ] Resume link should work

## Build for Production

When ready to deploy:

```bash
npm run build
```

This creates an optimized build in the `dist/` folder. The files are ready to deploy to GitHub Pages.

## Common Issues

### Issue: "Cannot find module 'React'"
**Solution**: Run `npm install` to install dependencies

### Issue: Images not loading
**Solution**: Ensure `media/` folder is in the `public/` directory

### Issue: Port 5173 already in use
**Solution**: Vite will automatically use the next available port, or you can specify one with `npm run dev -- --port 3000`

### Issue: Hot reload not working
**Solution**: Make sure you're accessing the correct local URL shown in the terminal output from `npm run dev`
